## Introduction

With the further deterioration of global warming since the 21st century and the important role of greenhouse gas emissions in the greenhouse effect, governments around the world have deeply realized that it is time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through international cooperation to gradually curb the rapid rise in global average temperature. In this context, the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 became an important milestone for countries around the world to jointly curb global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.As we all know, the large amount of carbon dioxide gas produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is one of the main causes of global warming. Therefore, this report will mainly explore the fossil fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions in countries around the world before and after the signing of the Paris Agreement.

## Research Question

In the face of increasingly serious environmental problems in this century, this report studies the carbon emission levels of countries around the world before and after the signing of the Paris Agreement by obtaining data on carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel use in various countries over the past 20 years. At the same time, this report will also study the carbon emission trends of countries with different income levels based on the World Bank's income level classification of countries.

## Dataset Introduction

The data used in this report records the carbon emissions and fossil fuel use levels of major countries in the world from 2004 to 2023. The data comes from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and includes six indicators such as "per capita carbon dioxide emissions", "per capita fossil fuel use", and "historical population", covering 20 major countries in the world. The GDP of these countries in 2023 accounts for more than 70% of the world's total GDP, so it can fully represent the global carbon emissions level. The original data has been archived in the project repository.
